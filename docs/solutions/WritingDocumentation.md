# Writing Feature Documentation:
When writing documentation for a new feature or extending it for existing one make sure you covered following:
- **Flow Proptypes**: first of - documentation in code, get sure you have props everywhere.
- **[react-stylyguidist](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist)** - generate documentation for props, add descriptions for each non-self-explanatory one 
- **Diagrams** - in case you are building component with logic complexity be sure to add explanation diagram(s) for the workflow and structure. Remember one picture could be more helpful than thousand words.
- **Todos & FixMes**: it is fine when you can resolve them, but if not - describe each in documentation.
- **Tradeoffs**: similar to previous ones - if you feel something is not ideal in your implementation - write it out.
